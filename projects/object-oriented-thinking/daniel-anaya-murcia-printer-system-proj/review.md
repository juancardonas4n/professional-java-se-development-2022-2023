* Objects, classes and relationships![image-20230117121315702](/home/juancardona/Workbench/professional-java-se-development-2022-2023/images/image-20230117121315702.png)
* Class diagram![image-20230117125924008](/home/juancardona/Workbench/professional-java-se-development-2022-2023/images/image-20230117125924008.png)
* The user requirements need to be reformulated.
* The use case are not formal as we expected. 
* The Objects and relationship is simpler, there is not relationship between scanned document and student, and the information about each printer.
* The Class diagram is incompleted with relation object diagram.
