## Notes

* Requirement for the system ![image-20230118150836998](/home/juancardona/.var/app/io.typora.Typora/config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20230118150836998.png)
* Use cases 1![image-20230118151528845](/home/juancardona/Workbench/professional-java-se-development-2022-2023/images/image-20230118151528845.png)
* Use cases 2![image-20230118152507472](/home/juancardona/Workbench/professional-java-se-development-2022-2023/images/image-20230118152507472.png)
* Use cases 3![image-20230118152553966](/home/juancardona/Workbench/professional-java-se-development-2022-2023/images/image-20230118152553966.png)
* Use cases 4![image-20230118152748418](/home/juancardona/Workbench/professional-java-se-development-2022-2023/images/image-20230118152748418.png)
* Use cases 5![image-20230118152848845](/home/juancardona/Workbench/professional-java-se-development-2022-2023/images/image-20230118152848845.png)
* Objects, classes and relationships. It creates a complete and complex class diagram with everything.
* Class diagram. ![image-20230118153026350](/home/juancardona/Workbench/professional-java-se-development-2022-2023/images/image-20230118153026350.png)
* The use cases are well defined. All functional requirements are described on the use cases.
* There is not a complete stage about the objects, classes, and relationships.
* The class diagram uses interfaces but there is not visible theirs implementations.
