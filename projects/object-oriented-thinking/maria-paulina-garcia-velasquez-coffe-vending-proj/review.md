## Criterias
| Criteria                                | Description                                                  | Points |
| :-------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| **Requirement for the system**          | There is a good description of the requirements: functional and non-functional. | 7      |
| **Use cases**                           | There is a graphical description, well-formed, using elements didn't teach in the course as extensions, generalizations, etc. | 7      |
| **Objects, classes, and relationships** | The objects, classes, and relationships were identified by using CRC Cards. On those CRC Cards, there is a complete set of classes that describe the use cases. | 8      |
| **Class diagrams**                      | The class diagram represents the relationship found in the previous point. Those relationships are well-designed. | 8      |

* The requirements don't need to be too specific describing what kind of coffee the machine will prepare.
* The CRC cards are suitable as a first attempt, but they need more work to produce and identify all classes altogether.
* Remember that this project is an embedded system, it would require another approach. Trying to identify hardware components also.
* The class diagram needs to identify the components that can be abstract classes or interfaces.
* The diagram expects you to try how to apply design patterns.
