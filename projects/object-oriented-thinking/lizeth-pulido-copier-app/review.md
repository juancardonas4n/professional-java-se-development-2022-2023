* Some functional requirements are too specific. They could be more generic. Don't indicate the specific paper size. Instead indicates that the application will manage different types of papers.
* The classes describe a part of the project, but it is not complete because it doesn't take into account registering of each transaction, and keeps money movements.
* How do you print a document in your application design?
