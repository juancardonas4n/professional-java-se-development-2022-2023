## Criterias
| Criteria                                | Description                                                  | Points |
| :-------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| **Requirement for the system**          | Both requirements are defined: as functional and non-functional. | 7      |
| **Uses cases**                          | The use cases focus on errors more than successful scenarios. | 7      |
| **Objects, classes, and relationships** | The analysis of classes, objects, and responsibilities is incomplete. The document is more focused on generic cases than concrete cases. | 4      |
| **Class diagrams**                      | Due to the previous point, its design is incomplete. There are more concrete cases. We don't expect all issues to be considered, but at least more cases were taken into account. | 4      |
